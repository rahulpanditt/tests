# Swin Transformer for Deepfake Detection

## Why Use a Pre-Trained Model?
Swin Transformer was originally trained on **ImageNet** for general image classification. If we want to use it for **deepfake detection**, we have two choices:

1. **Fine-Tune a Pre-Trained Model** (Recommended for most cases)
2. **Train from Scratch** (Requires a large dataset and computational power)

### ✅ Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Swin Transformer (Recommended)
A Swin Transformer trained on **ImageNet** has already learned:
- **Basic visual patterns** (edges, textures, shapes)
- **Object structures** (faces, backgrounds, lighting)
- **General feature extraction** that applies to many vision tasks

When fine-tuning, we **only adjust the last few layers** so the model specializes in **detecting fake vs. real images**, while still leveraging its existing knowledge of facial structures.

#### 🔥 Advantages of Fine-Tuning
✅ **Faster training** (Pre-learned features reduce training time)
✅ **Better accuracy with fewer samples**
✅ **Less computational cost**

### ❌ Training Swin Transformer from Scratch
If we want to **train Swin Transformer entirely from scratch**, we need to:
1. **Initialize a fresh Swin Transformer model**
2. **Extract features from deepfake images**
3. **Train the entire network without pre-trained knowledge**

#### 📌 Steps for Training from Scratch
1. Load a **randomly initialized Swin Transformer** (no pre-training)
2. Train it on a **deepfake dataset** (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, or DFDC)
3. Optimize hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, augmentation, etc.)

#### 🔥 Disadvantages of Training from Scratch
❌ **Needs millions of deepfake images** for good accuracy
❌ **Requires massive computational resources** (GPUs for weeks/months)
❌ **Training is slow and less stable**

### 🆚 Fine-Tuning vs. Training from Scratch
| **Method** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Swin** | Faster training, higher accuracy with fewer data | May not generalize well to deepfakes |
| **Training from Scratch** | Fully customized, learns deepfake-specific features | Needs a large dataset & long training |

👉 If your dataset is **small**, fine-tuning is better.  
👉 If you have **millions of deepfake images**, training from scratch might work better.

## Alternative: Extract Features, Then Train a Classifier
If full training is **too expensive**, another approach is:
1. Extract **features from raw deepfake images** using Swin Transformer.
2. Train a smaller classifier like **SVM, Random Forest, or MLP** on those features.

### 📌 Extract Features from Deepfake Dataset
```python
# Extract feature vectors from Swin Transformer

def extract_features(image_path):
    image_tensor = preprocess_image(image_path).to(device)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        features = model.forward_features(image_tensor)  # Get feature map
    
    return features.squeeze(0).cpu().numpy()  # Convert to NumPy array
```

### 📌 Train an SVM on Extracted Features
```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import numpy as np

# Prepare feature dataset
image_paths = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]
labels = [0, 1, 0]  # 0 = real, 1 = fake

X = np.array([extract_features(img) for img in image_paths])
y = np.array(labels)

# Train SVM
svm_classifier = SVC(kernel='linear', probability=True)
svm_classifier.fit(X, y)
```
✅ This allows training a **lightweight classifier on extracted Swin features**.

## Final Recommendations
- If you **have limited data**, **fine-tune** Swin Transformer.
- If you **have a large deepfake dataset**, **train from scratch**.
- If you **want a fast solution**, extract **Swin features and use an SVM**.
